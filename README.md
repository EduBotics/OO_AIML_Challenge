A set of challenges to exercise programming skills. (Aimed particularly at Python, but any language will do; ideally one with built-in OO syntax, but even that's not a requirement!)

The challenges introduce both Object Oriented (OO) ideas, and are based around some fundamental elements behind Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

The first challenge is in the subdirectory [Challenge_pt1](https://github.com/EduBotics/OO_AIML_Challenge/tree/master/Challenge_pt1)
